-- TODO --

-- Important --
- include a way to tell the player about everything they can create (ctrl modifier)
- show mass for followed entity
- add a visual way to tell type of an entity
- sliders for zoom and object mass
- less randomness
- better sized ships
- scale alpha based on mass
- improve UI colors
- grid snapping (binded to alt I guess)
- click on objects to follow them
- mass of earth compared to sun

-- Bugs --
- fix weird ship disappearing bug
- some camera spectator bug somewhere
- things not disappearing on clear bug

-- Dream Features --
- make trace colors lighter with less mass
- increase/reduce speed
- multiple color themes
- experiment with larger objects moving
- dynamic canvas
- snapping
- find center point
- add camera focus rotation (switch between them automatically)
- perhaps more game-like feautures
- have objects "evolve" as they gain mass
- lasers
- slow field
- clarity of line traces (multiple canvases for different zoom levels)
- spawn ships from planets
- thrusters for ships
- presets
