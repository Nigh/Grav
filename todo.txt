- fix minimum resize
- toggle lines to show object speed
- grid snapping (binded to alt I guess)
- look at mass of earth compared to sun
- add a ship spawner
- make trace colors lighter with less mass
- increase/reduce speed
- multiple color themes
- experiment with larger objects moving
- dynamic canvas creation (create a smaller canvas where it is needed)
- snapping
- find center point of gravity (where gravity is 0)
- add camera focus rotation (switch between them automatically)
- perhaps more game-like feautures
- have objects "evolve" as they gain mass
- lasers
- slow field
- clarity of line traces (multiple canvases for different zoom levels)
- spawn ships from planets
- thrusters for ships
